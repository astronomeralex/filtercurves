filtercurves
============

Contains lots of filter transmission curves all in one convenient location!



These filtercurves were originally compiled for SED fitting purposes using the program GalMC (Acquaviva et al 2011).
Given the requriements of that program they are in units of angstroms for wavelength and the wavelength spacing is equal
to or greater than one angstroms.

Many of the filter curves come from the following websites
